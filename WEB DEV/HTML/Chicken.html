            The Thread Between Us
        </h4>
        <p>In the quiet of days, when the world feels vast,<br>
            Thereâ€™s a thread between us, strong and steadfast. <br>
            Unseen by the eye but known to the heart, <br>
            It weaves through the moments, though miles keep us apart <br>.</p>
        <h1><b> Chicken </b></h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird,
            domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are
            raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as pets or for <a

        <p>Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of <span>26.5 billion</span>
            as of 2023, and an annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can
            produce over 300 eggs per year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore,
            religion, and literature.</p>

        <h2>Discription</h2>
        <p>
            Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most
            breeds,
            and the wings are short. <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com">[19]</a></sup> Wild junglefowl can fly;
            chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow
            them to fly more than a short distance.[20] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[19]
            Newly-hatched
            chicks of both modern and heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties however
            grow
            much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb) of a
            heritage chicken of the same age.[21]
